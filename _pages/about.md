I'm interested in how mathematical thinking and programming can optimize processes. My focus is on finding elegant solutions to complex problems through careful analysis and creativity.

My interest in optimization began with competitive programming, where I learned to approach problems systematically. Now I apply those same principles as a computer engineering student, always looking for ways to improve efficiency and design.

I explore this as an intern at [CEFIM](https://www.up.ac.za/carl-emily-fuchs-institute-for-microelectronics-cefim) for the [Nano-Micro Manufacturing Facility](https://nmmf.co.za/), where I work on sensor systems. Whether it's improving algorithms or designing electronic systems, I enjoy the challenge of making systems work better.
